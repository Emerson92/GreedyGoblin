# GreedyGoblin
This is a Game created by Unity3d with  C# language.The Game Theme is about a GreedyGoblin who want to collect more treasure,and he was trapped into a small Area.thought this Area was full of the danger,he still insisit to colloct those treasure beause of the greedy.All the Model  and music are come from WOW(World of Warcraft)，In fact I am a fan of  the WOW.I am try my best to use the material from WOW,but this is game that still lack of a lots of element that I can‘t find in the internet.I hope everybody can join me to complete this Beatifull Game!
